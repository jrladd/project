The *Project* Project
=================

It's a common problem in network analysis. You've got bipartite network data, but you'd like to reduce it to unipartite data in order to run metrics.

Worry no more! Simply drag and drop your CSV of bipartite data into the box below. (Don't include a header row!) It will assume the first column is one type of node and the second column is another.

Just select the column you want to use as the nodes in your final projected graph, and voila! And don't worry: this app doesn't retrieve or store any of your data. It all stays on your computer alone. 

The inspiration for this app came from the many smart people at the Getty Advanced Workshop for Network Analysis and Digital Art History in Pittsburgh PA, the week of July 29, 2019.
